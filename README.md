# Conceptual-Compiler
A Compiler Made for Program Interpretation Class CS 4280

## Summary
This was a project for a computer science class I took for my bachelors. We had a pseudo language that followed C-style syntax, and we had to make a compiler to translate that language into a assembly language known as UM-Assembly, which we could run on a custom, simulated operating system. The program contains a fully functional assembler, FSA Table, Parser, Scanner, Tree Builder, and Semantics Checker.  

## Systems Tested On
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- RedHat 5

## Compiler Needed
- g++ 4.8.5 (Higher may work, but is untested)

## Build Process
Step 1: clone this repo (git clone) or download it as a zip

Step 2: navigate into directory and then navigate into it

Step 3: Run: make

Step 4: Run ./genCode -h to see how to use it
